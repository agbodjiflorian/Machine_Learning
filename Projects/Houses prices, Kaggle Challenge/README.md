# Description

You are a data scientist working for an investment company operating in the Czech Republic.
Your task is to create the most accurate prediction model of apartment prices.
The data department of the company you work for has given you all the "sold" apartments from the Sreality.cz portal.
Sold flats are those flats that have disappeared from the portal and have not appeared under the same identification number.
The target variable is price.
Your model will be evaluated on the following month, i.e. data obtained from January 2021.

The primary goal of this competition is to develop accurate predictive models that can estimate apartment prices based on a wealth of property attributes and geospatial data. By leveraging these insights, participants aim to create valuable tools for both prospective homebuyers and the real estate industry in the Czech Republic.
